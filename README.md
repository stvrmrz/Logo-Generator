<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Logo Generator Demo

![Project Blog Post Demo](/assets/10-oop-homework-demo.png)

This project was about creating a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

## Roadmap

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
- [x] WHEN I am prompted for text
      THEN I can enter up to three characters
- [x] WHEN I am prompted for the text color
      THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
- [x] WHEN I am prompted for a shape
      THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
- [x] WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
      THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
- [x] WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
      THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg` AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
- [x] WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
      THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
